OVERVIEW.

In this project, I worked on a regression problem to predict the house price of real estate. I used three different models as well as used various error metrics in order to evaluate the models' performance. I used Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression and Decision Tree Regression in this project. Accuracy metrics used: Mean absolute error, Mean absolute percentage error and R2 score. The data used comprised of 414 records(rows) with 8 fields(columns). A field (No) was dropped making it a total of 7 fields used for the project.

PricePrediction.ipynb contains the project codes.
Real estate.csv is the data used for this project sourced from Kaggle.

Python packages used for this project: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Google Colab Notebook was used to run this.
